# SnakeGame
## Introduction
This is project that implements the classic snake game, where the player starts with a small moving snake that they can control to move around and eat pellets. Eating pellets increases the snake's size as well as speed, and when the snake crashes into itself, or the wall, it dies, the game is over and the player is given the option to restart.
